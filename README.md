- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheOldCoder. Been writing code since I was a freshman at MIT in 1970. It's all I've ever wanted to do in terms of making a living.
I'm retired now and still devote 1-2 hours every morning to learning and coding, learning about coding, and coding about learning.

- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning. How to get a computer to teach itself. Mostly it interests me because I find the more I learn about computers, the more I learn about myself.
Very 'meta,' no? Learning about learning.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Clojure. Really like it as a programming language.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...Not sure I want to collaborate. I'm still learning and I don't even know what questions to ask.
I really like the dudes who help me on Stack Overflow. Their patience really comforts me.

- 📫 How to reach me ... Email is probably best: QCO@QuietCounsel.org
